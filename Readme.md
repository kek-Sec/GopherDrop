| `DB_NAME`     | Database name                   | `gopherdropdb`                |
| `SECRET_KEY`  | Secret key for encryption       | `supersecretkeysupersecretkey32` |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | API listen address              | `:8080`                       |
| `STORAGE_PATH`| Path for storing uploaded files | `/app/storage`                |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | Maximum file size in bytes    | `10485760` (10 MB)            |

## 🖥️ **Endpoints**

### **API Endpoints**

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                               |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/send`                  | Create a new send (text or file)          |
| `GET`  | `/send/:id`              | Retrieve a send by its hash               |
| `GET`  | `/send/:id/check`        | Check if a send requires a password       |

### **Example: Create a Send**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/send \
  -F "type=text" \
  -F "data=This is a secret message" \
  -F "password=mysecurepassword"
```

## 🌐 **UI**

The UI provides a simple way to create and view sends.

### **Create a Send**

1. Go to `http://localhost:8081`
2. Enter your secret (text or file).
3. Set an optional password and expiration.
4. Click **Create** and share the generated link.

### **View a Send**

1. Open the provided link.
2. If password-protected, enter the password.
3. View or copy the secret.

## 🐳 **Docker Deployment**

To deploy GopherDrop using Docker Compose:

```bash
make build
make up
```

---

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted with AES-256 before storage.
- **Passwords**: Optional password protection for additional security.
- **One-Time Use**: Option to delete sends after a single access.
- **Expiration**: Sends auto-delete after the set expiration time.
